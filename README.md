# security_cam_with_facial_recognition
security camera implementation using openCV

I have used Raspberry pi 2 for this project

Instructions on how to install openCV on the raspberry pi:
https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-opencv/

Once installed go the folder where the files are stored and in the terminal window :
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Make necessary changes to the main.py and mail.py for it to work.

Then just type python3 main.py
